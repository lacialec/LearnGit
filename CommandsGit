First of all we create Repo on the Git

Open Terminal or Git Bash on the Local Pc and then 

git clone  XXXXX XXXXX where XXXX is the url address from the Repo

The repo now is on the Local Pc from the Terminal we switch now to local

git checkout -b "XXXX XXXX "  where XXXX for what will be used the Repo

From the Terminal we can start directly VS Code which points to the local repo with the command 

code .

We create files , we modify the Readme and etc ... After we are done first we make Check 

The check to see what is added/modified can be seen with command 

git status

Aftet that 

git add .   #Add the files to the local repo

After we add the files we make commit 

git commit -am "XXXX XXXXX "  #Where XXX XXXX is the changes that we done

With this steps we are done on local side and we will continue now to upload this to the repo in the cloud

git push  #When you execute for the first time copy and execute the command that Git suggest you

With this steps now in the cloud repo we have 2 branches. 1 is master and 1 is the branch that we push now.

After this we should create Pull Request. 

We have 2 types of PQ : 

- Merge which means the new branch that we created to be Merged with the master.
